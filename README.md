# precise64-lamp cookbook
LAMP stack in your server or virtual environment!

Just a [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/) cookbook created using [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/). Ignore most of it. [metadata.rb](https://github.com/awc737/precise64-lamp-cookbook/blob/master/metadata.rb) contains a load of [Opscode](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks) cookbooks required for a premium LAMP stack!

# Usage
Only tested with [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) Precise.

Include it in your Vagrantfile. Or, it's already been included in the [joomla-vagrant](https://github.com/awc737/joomla-vagrant) environment.

It's that easy!
